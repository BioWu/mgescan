MGEScan on Galaxy Workflow
===============================================================================

MGEScan on Galaxy is the latest version of MGEScan to identify long
terminal repeats (LTR) and non-LTR retroelements in eukaryotic genomic
sequences on a web interface or on a command line. HMMER v3.1b1 and openMPI are
supported for MGEScan-LTR and MGEScan-nonLTR programs so the better performance
is guaranteed than previous version of MGEScan. Cloud image is available on
Amazon Cloud (EC2) to utilize on-demand computing resources for data analysis.
